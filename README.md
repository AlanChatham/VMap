VMap
====

If you're looking to use VMap, go to the Releases tab (https://github.com/AlanChatham/VMap/releases) and download it from there. The .zip code download will download the Eclipse project for actually developing the library, which does NOT contain the files you need to use the code from within processing.

Fork of Ixagon AB's SurfaceMapper library for Processing (http://www.ixagon.se/surfacemapper/), updated to work with Processing 2
